Cellular transfection is a fundamental technique in molecular biology for introducing nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, 
into living cells. This method plays a crucial role in many areas of research, including cell biology, biotechnology and 
gene therapy. By enabling targeted genetic manipulation and the study of cellular mechanisms, cell transfection offers 
promising opportunities for the understanding of biological processes and the development of new therapies.

Transfection efficiency often depends on several factors, including the type of cells used, the transfection method, 
and optimal ratios of nucleic acids to transfection agents. Among the most commonly used transfection agents are 
Lipofectamine 2000, Lipofectamine 3000 from Invitrogen, and jetPRIME from Polyplus-transfection. These reagents are 
designed to enhance the uptake and delivery of nucleic acids into cells, thereby facilitating the transfection process.


## About Transfection Ratio Xpert
This application aims to simplify the process of calculating the necessary ratios between DNA and transfection agents 
during cell transfection. By providing a user-friendly interface and advanced calculation tools, it allows researchers 
and scientists to optimize their transfection experiments, explore different parameters and generate personalized 
experimental conditions. Please note that this application is intended for calculation assistance purposes only and 
may contain errors. We recommend that you independently verify the results obtained before making decisions based on them.
